# Hugo Wileys Portfolio website

Portfolio website for a fictional designer.

## WTF is this?

Based on [Caler Edwards video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZNmqe7nYA&list=PLD6pbWV1WAgMUE78mE8zTDOlE9FPvsPTW&index=2) I coded up a one-page portfolio website using Pug, SCSS, JS and a little bit of magic

## What was used
* HTML5 & CSS3 (Pug.js)
* SCSS
* [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/)

## What I learned
* How to implement position relative and absolute in 2019
* Practiced using before/after pseudo-elements
* Practiced implementing ScrollReveal plugin

## Problems/Issues
* Could'nt get pseudo-element to animate. Need to look it up.

Pretty much use it however you like.
